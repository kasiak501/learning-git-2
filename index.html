	<h1>The Rolling Stones - Happy</h1>
	<h4>Authors: Mick Jagger, Keith Richards</h4>
	<p>Well I never kept a dollar past sunset, It always burned a hole in my pants. Never made a school mama happy, Never blew a second chance, oh no</p>
	<p>I need a love to keep me happy, I need a love to keep me happy. Baby, baby keep me happy. Baby, baby keep me happy.</p>
